# Linkedin-JobAnalytics
LinkedIn Job Analytics is a data-driven project that leverages Python, Beautiful Soup, and Selenium to scrape and analyze job information from LinkedIn. It offers insights on industry trends, top job locations, and company analysis. With visualizations and tables, users gain valuable insights for optimizing their job search strategies.




## Prerequisites

1. **Web Scraping using Python**:
   - [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/): A Python library used for automating web browsers, which is essential for web scraping.
   - [Time](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html): A standard Python library that provides various time-related functions, useful for adding delays in web scraping operations.
   - [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/): A powerful data manipulation library in Python, used for data analysis and handling structured data.
   - [NumPy](https://numpy.org/): A fundamental package for scientific computing in Python, used for working with large arrays and matrices.

2. **Google Chrome Browser Driver**:
   - To access web pages using Python and interact with them through the Chrome browser, you'll need to install the appropriate [Chrome browser driver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/).

3. **Python Jupyter Notebook**:
   - Used for data cleaning and data separation tasks.
   - [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) and [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/): Required libraries for working with numerical arrays and structured data within Jupyter Notebook.

4. **Excel**:
   - Utilized for data storage purposes. You can export and save your data in Excel format for further analysis or sharing.

5. **SQL**:
   - Used for data analysis to extract insights from the collected data.
   - Basic SQL knowledge is necessary to perform data querying and analysis tasks.

6. **Tableau**:
   - A powerful data visualization tool that helps create interactive and visually appealing dashboards and reports based on your data analysis.

Make sure you have the necessary installations and setups for the above tools and libraries before running the LinkedIn Job Analysis project.
